    <para>Data Files are external sources of data for your scripts. The
        lines will get evenly divided up among the agents
        for use.

                Before uploading scripts or test data to Intuit Tank be
                aware that others will potentially have access to this information. This access can
                be via Tank controller directly or potentially by capturing the
                http requests going across the network when running tests. For this reason
                we ask that you do not store, retrieve sensitive data, or save
                scripts with hard coded credentials in Intuit Tank. This could include real
                customer data (PII), trade secrets, employee data, etc.
                If you have a need to use such data please contact your information security team for
                guidance before uploading to Intuit Tank. Just for clarification Intuit Tank does
                encrypt data when storing to S3 and encrypts at rest to the Intuit Tank database.

        Clicking the

        tab takes the user to the main screen, which lists all the
        previously
        created
        Data Files.

        Currently, Intuit Tank supports data files with CSV (Comma Separated Values),
        and XML format only. The data file is read
        into
        shared memory only once, even if it is read by multiple virtual users.
        Usually you will use one of the functions
        below only once in your script for each file you load. The following two
        functions can be used in Intuit Tank to read
        a file:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>#{ioFunctions.getCSVData(COLUMN_NUMBER)</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>This function is used to read a default data file
                    associated
                    with the project. A Data File is default if
                    there is only one in a particular job.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>


        <varlistentry>
            <term>#{ioFunctions.getCSVData('FILE_NAME', COLUMN_NUMBER)
            </term>
            <listitem>
                <para>This function can be used to read a specific data
                    file
                    when
                    you have to read from multiple data files used
                    for
                    the same script or multiple scripts in a project (i.e. separate data
                    files for personal information and
                    login
                    credentials).
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <note>
        <para>Column Number 0 represents the 1st column in the file.
